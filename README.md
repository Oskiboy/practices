# Practices

Practices in TDT4102 spring 2018.
A place to stash all my practices online.

## Practice 1:

Simple stuff.
Transcribing Python and simple arithmetics.

## Practice 2:

Loops, functions, and program flow.
I used multiple files, but that should not be necessary.

## Practice 3:

Functions and pointers! Wohoo! Made a cannon shooting game, which was fun.

## Practice 4:

Loads of functions and c-strings. Implemented an easy mastermind game.
This was such a pain because of arrays and char type is a bitch!

## Practice 5:
Made a blackjack game and a few classes.

## Practice 6:
SFML and graphics. Made a game of the cannon stuff from practice 3.

## Practice 7:
Dynamic memory and Matrices. Fun little project to keep building on!

## Practice 8:
Filestreams, maps and other streams.
